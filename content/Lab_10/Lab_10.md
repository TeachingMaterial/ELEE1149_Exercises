# Lab 10

1. Read through the document Use Case Diagrams provided on the course web page on moodle for this week.

2. Using Visio, in the category Software and database, use the UML Use Case to develop a set of use cases based on your knowledge of how to use an ATM. The use cases should cover the main ATM functions, such as:
   - withdraw cash, 
   - display balance, 
   - print statement and 
   - change pin. 

Also do a description of each use case for the following categories: the actors involved, the inputs and the outputs, normal operation and exceptions. Examples of exceptions can be: invalid card, incorrect PIN, insufficient balance, etc.   Use paper or Word to input this information.

1. Read the two documents provided on the course page on moodle about UML Class and Sequence Diagrams.  Using Visio, draw the class and sequence diagrams from these two documents provided.  You will find both diagrams under Office/Software or Categories /Software and Database in Visio.

2. Develop a sequence diagram showing the interactions involved when a student registers for a course in a university. Courses may have limited enrolment, so the registration process must include checks that places are available. Assume that the student accesses an electronic course catalogue to find out about available courses. 

3. In your groups, start thinking and developing sequence diagrams and use case diagrams for the assignment.

4. As an additional help with drawing your diagrams, if you need to, check the following videos:
